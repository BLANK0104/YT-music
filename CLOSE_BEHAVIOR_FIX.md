# Close Behavior Fix

## Issue
When music is playing and clicking the X (close) button, the app doesn't properly handle the close event based on system tray settings.

## Solution
Added proper `close` event handler that:

1. **System Tray Enabled**: 
   - Prevents actual closure
   - Minimizes to system tray instead
   - Shows notification on first minimize (if desktop notifications enabled)
   - Allows music to continue playing in background

2. **System Tray Disabled**:
   - Allows normal window closure
   - App completely exits

## How it Works

### Close Event Handler
```javascript
mainWindow.on('close', (event) => {
    const settings = store.get('settings', defaultSettings);
    
    // If not quitting via menu/quit command and system tray is enabled
    if (!isQuiting && settings.systemTray) {
        event.preventDefault();
        mainWindow.hide();
        // Show notification and continue background playback
    }
    // Otherwise allow normal close
});
```

### Quit Methods
- **Tray Menu Quit**: Sets `isQuiting = true` and calls `app.quit()`
- **Menu Bar Quit**: Sets `isQuiting = true` and calls `app.quit()`
- **Keyboard Shortcut Quit** (Ctrl+Q): Sets `isQuiting = true` and calls `app.quit()`

## Testing

### With System Tray Enabled
1. Start app with system tray enabled in settings
2. Play music
3. Click X button → App minimizes to tray, music continues
4. Right-click tray icon → Select "Quit" → App actually closes

### With System Tray Disabled
1. Start app with system tray disabled in settings
2. Play music  
3. Click X button → App closes completely

## Benefits
- ✅ Intuitive behavior: Close button respects system tray setting
- ✅ Music continues in background when appropriate
- ✅ User notification on first minimize to tray
- ✅ Proper quit functionality via tray/menu
- ✅ No confusion about whether app is running or not

## User Experience
- First-time users get helpful notification explaining tray behavior
- Music playback is preserved when user expects background operation
- Clear distinction between "hide to tray" and "quit application"
